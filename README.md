# Aggregate-function-in-SQL
INTRODUCTION

Aggregate functions in SQL are used to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single result. These functions operate on a group of rows and produce a single value as output. Some common aggregate functions in SQL include: COUNT, SUM, MAX, MIN, AVERAGE

WHAT AN AGGREGATE FUNCTION IN SQL?

An aggregate function in SQL returns one value after calculating multiple values of a column. We often use aggregate functions with the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses of the SELECT statement.
There are 5 types of SQL aggregate functions:
Count()
Sum()
Avg()
Min()
Max()

COLUMN REFERENCING

In SQL, aggregate functions are used to calculate a set of values and return a single value. When using aggregate functions in SQL, it is crucial to understand column references. A column reference is a name containing the data you want to aggregate. To use an aggregate function with a column reference, specify the column's name in the function's parentheses. For example, to find the average salary of employees in a table called "employees", you would use the AVG function with the column reference "salary" like this: 

SELECT AVG (salary)
FROM employees; 

Using column aliases instead of column references is also possible for a more readable code. However, understanding column references is essential when working with SQL aggregate functions.

WHY USE AGGREGATE FUNCTION?

Aggregate functions are a vital component of database management systems. They allow us to perform calculations on large data sets quickly and efficiently. For example, these functions generate statistical reports, perform financial analysis, and manage inventory levels. 
In addition, we can better understand the data we are working with by using aggregate functions. For example, we can easily calculate the average price of all products in our inventory or find the total sales for a particular time. Without aggregate functions, we would need to manually sort through each data point, which would be time-consuming and error-prone. Overall, aggregate functions are essential for anyone working with large amounts of data and seeking to gain valuable insights from it.

AGGREGATE FUNCTION WITH HAVING CLAUSE

HAVING CLAUSE
-- The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.
-- HAVING clause refine the output from records that do not satisfy a certain condition 
-- HAVING is between group by and ORDER  by clause

CONCLUSION
Understanding how to leverage these functions effectively allows SQL users to derive valuable insights from data and efficiently extract the information needed for various analytical purposes, from simple statistics to complex trend analysis.
